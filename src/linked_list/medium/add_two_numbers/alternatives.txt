NOTE: The following alternatives are sub-optimal.

a. Reverse and Add (for non-reversed lists)
    If the lists were provided in normal order, we would need to reverse them first, add the numbers using the iterative approach, 
    and then reverse the result.

        * Time Complexity: O(m + n)
        * Space Complexity: O(m + n)

b. Conversion to Integer and Addition (Not Optimal for Large Inputs)
    1. Convert both linked lists to integers.
    2. Add the two integers.
    3. Convert the sum back to a linked list.

    Drawbacks:
    - Integer overflow for very large inputs.
    - Requires O(max(m, n)) space for the conversion.
