1. Get a README.md for this problem
2. Add similar problems section:
    * Subarrays with K different integers (hard)
    * Maximum Erasure Value (med)
    * Minimum Consecutive cards to pick up... (med)
    * Longest Nice Subarray (med)
    * optimal partition of string (med)
    * count complete Subarrays in an array (med)
3. There are a few cast operations happening in some of the solutions. see if we can clean these up to at least minimize the casting operations.
