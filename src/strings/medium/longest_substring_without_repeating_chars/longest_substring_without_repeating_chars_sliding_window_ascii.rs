/*
Length of Longest Substring - Sliding Window ASCII
Approach:           * Use two pointers (left and right) to maintain a sliding window of unique
                      characters.
                    * If the input is limited to ASCII characters (256 unique chars), we can
                      use a fixed-size array INSTEAD of a HashMap.

Time Complexity:    O(n) â€” We traverse the string once.
Space Complexity:   O(1) (Fixed array size)
