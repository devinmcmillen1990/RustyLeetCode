/*
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Note:
    - Given target value is a floating point.
    - You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Example:

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: 4

/*
Strategy (Optimal): BST Property + Greedy Search
    - Since itâ€™s a BST:
        - Go left if target < node.val
        - Go right if target > node.val
    - Track the closest value as you go.
    - Time: O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
